			<p>1 cushion. 1 mat. 1 hour. Come, sit, then go home. Or wherever you go when youâ€™re not here.</p>
			<p>No annoying teachers or priests. No statues or trinkets. No robes or rakusus. No bells or whistles. No boring talks. No chanting. No candles. No incense. No koans. No dues.</p>

			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Amidst the wreckage of what Zen and Buddhism has become in the West &#8212 personality, opinion, politics, materialism, and feelings &#8212 we come together to sit on cushions.</p>
			<p>We don't do "enlightenment." The human experience is like a hungry ghost clinging to Buddha nature and we sit for freedom from the tyranny of the false self, not bliss or peak experiences.</p>
			<p>Why participate? Well, in truth, you probably shouldn't. There's nothing to get - no trophies, no recognition.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>This is about original Zen. It is about responsibility, truth, and protecting and preserving all life. If you've been exposed to a modern Buddhist experience, one that is meant to make you feel good, you may not like us.</p>
			<p>There's no fake compassion or niceness here. We don't believe in welfare or handouts. We don't do identity politics and we are not intersectional. We believe in you as a human not as your status as a victim. And we believe in the sacredness of all sentient beings, in the womb and out.</p>
